# Python code for overlap reduction functions

This is a Python code to numerically calculate the overlap reduction functions (ORFs) for the redshift modification in pulsar timing array (PTA) and the deflections in astrometry.
The formulas are given in arXiv:240X.XXXXX.

- [orf_calculation_auto_pta.ipynb](orf_numerical_calculation/orf_calculation_auto_pta.ipynb) is for the ORFs of auto-correlation of PTA redshifts. 
- [orf_calculation_auto_astrometry.ipynb](orf_numerical_calculation/orf_calculation_auto_astrometry.ipynb) is for the ORFs of auto-correlation of astrometry deflections. 
- [orf_calculation_cross.ipynb](orf_numerical_calculation/orf_calculation_cross.ipynb) is for the ORFs of cross-correlation between PTA redshift and astrometry deflection.
