# Python codes for overlap reduction functions

This code calculates the overlap reduction function (ORF) for the redshift modification in pulsar timing array and the deflections in astrometry.

``functions.py'' is the module for the functions.

[orf_calculation_auto_pta.ipynb](orf_numerical_calculation/orf_calculation_auto_pta.ipynb) is for the ORFs of auto-correlation of PTA redshifts. 

``orf_calculation_auto_astrometry.ipynb'' is for the ORFs of auto-correlation of astrometry deflections. 

``orf_calculation_cross.ipynb'' is for the ORFs of cross-correlation between PTA redshift and astrometry deflection.
